About
======

This fork will be a port to spongespowered.org plugin. I have no idea how easy this is going to be. Probably will take months for me to do anything with this. Just a heads up. Also once I am done I don't plan on maintaining it. But in the great spirit of open source works I will allow anyone to take it from here. 

Big shout out to the origional dev and devs since who made this wonderfull software for us to use and be inspired.



LazyRoad

Very simple plugin that allows you to quickly build roads, bridges, tunnels and more. Just type a command and then walk, the road will create itself as you walk.
